The advent of the internet era has brought about a sea change in how we read. While verbose literature ruled the roost in the past, it is now falling behind to quick, snappy writing that gets the point across using less words, while taking up less of the reader’s time.

This is a very important lesson to keep in mind if you are writing for an internet audience. Blog writing is the order of the day when it comes to online writing, with even successful entrepreneurs reaching out through the medium. But it can be easily confused with article writing, which is a different ballgame altogether. Writers may end up confusing the two, and as a result, your work might just fail to appeal to your core audience the way you want it to. It is crucial to understand the differences between blogs and articles as the two can often be confused. Here’s a quick guide that aims to help you distinguish the two.

**SEO keywords**

- Search Engine Optimisation helps content reach a wider audience and is a key factor behind blogs and write-ups going viral. Blogs are built around SEO keywords and the writing is often changed to incorporate the same. For example, in a blog about Manchester United Football Club, the author will have to include key terms such as ‘Red Devils’, ‘Mourinho’ or ‘Man Utd’ for the piece to have better traction on the internet.

**Personal opinion**

The vast majority of articles, besides op-ed pieces, look to steer clear of personal opinion. They are based more on reportage, information, and statistics. However, blogs often describe things from a personal perspective, with a lesser reliance on reportage and data.
